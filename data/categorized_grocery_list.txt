After categorizing and sorting the grocery items, I present to you the following list:

**Fruits**
----------------
• Amla
• Apple
• Mango

**Grains**
-------------
• Rice
• Wheat

**Dairy**
-------------
• Ice cream

**Snacks**
---------
• Cake

**Household Items**
-------------------
• Broomstick
• Matchbox
• Pickle (typically a condiment, but can also be used as a snack)

Note: I've categorized pickle under Household Items as it doesn't fit well into other categories. If you'd like to categorize it differently, please let me know!

Let me know if this sorted list meets your requirements!
